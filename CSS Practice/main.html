                Reality bites. With its sharp claws, it digs into your skin and slowly tears it off, 
                leaving your palpitating crimson muscles exposed to the air as they burn with a fury 
                alien to you, and you feel each cell in your body catching fire, destroying you, 
                making you writhe in anguish as you clap your hands and beg for a wicked saviour to 
                appear with an axe in his hand to chop your head off, so you feel the pain no more.

                it laughs monstrously with an amused expression glossing its face, until your soul finally 
                leaves your body, having experienced the worst it could ever had.
